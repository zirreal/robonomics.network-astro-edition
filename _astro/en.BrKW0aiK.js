In an effort to solve these problems, it was proposed to bring data processing, logic, and computation closer to the immediate place where they are used.

The firm, with all its hierarchical extra-market structure, is formed as the most efficient way to provide the consumer with the target product with the lowest transaction costs at the moment, when the transactional effort to create the same product through multiple exchanges on the market between individuals becomes much higher. To best visualize this process, look at the illustrative example of buying a car.

The risks and negotiation costs of buying parts are too high compared to Tesla’s off-the-shelf Model X.",cd=()=>"Nevertheless, this does not lead to the emergence of the world’s only firm for the production of everything.
